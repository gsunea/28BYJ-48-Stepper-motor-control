# 28BYJ-48-Stepper-motor-control
3 different stepper motor controlling methods implemented in Arduino.
The implemented methods are:
  1. Wave Drive
  2. Full-Step Drive
  3. Half-Step Drive

Tested these methods on a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor with a ULN2003 driver.
For this motor the minimum delay is 2 ms (If you use the Half-Step Drive it is 1 ms ).
